Start your Spring Boot application and use tools like Postman or a web browser to test the endpoints:

Retrieve all students: GET http://localhost:8080/api/students
Retrieve a student by ID: GET http://localhost:8080/api/students/{id}
Create a new student: POST http://localhost:8080/api/students with a JSON body
Update a student: PUT http://localhost:8080/api/students/{id} with a JSON body
Delete a student: DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/students/{id}
